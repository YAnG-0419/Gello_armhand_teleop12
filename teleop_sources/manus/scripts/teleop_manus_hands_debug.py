"""Teleop the MANUS hands and capture everything a post-mortem needs, in one run.

    python teleop_manus_hands_debug.py --out-dir /home/descfly/franka_teleop_data \
        --sides both

Every argument other than `--out-dir`, `--left-state-topic`, `--right-state-topic`
and `--tag` is passed through to `teleop_manus_hands.py` unchanged, so this is a
drop-in wrapper: same keyboard UI, same flags, same behaviour.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Diagnosing a following failure needs three streams together:
what the glove reported, what the solver commanded, and what the hand actually
did. The first two are already one row per tick in the teleop debug log. The
third only exists as a ROS topic published by the hand driver, inside the
container -- and capturing it separately, in another terminal, leaves two files
with no guaranteed relationship. That is exactly the gap that made an earlier
investigation guess instead of measure.

HOW IT LINES UP. The teleop debug log stamps every row with `time.time_ns()`.
The recorder stamps every JointState with `time.time_ns()` too, from the same
host clock, and both run as children of this process for the same interval.
Merging is then a nearest-timestamp join with a stated tolerance, and the join
reports its own coverage rather than assuming it worked.

WHY TWO INTERPRETERS. The teleop stack runs in the `franka-teleop-pico` conda
env, which has casadi and pinocchio but no rclpy; rclpy lives in the system ROS
install. Rather than force one environment to hold both, the recorder is a
child process under `/opt/ros/*/setup.bash` and the two meet at the wall clock.

The merged file is the deliverable: one row per teleop tick, with `measured`
attached where the hand reported within tolerance. The unmerged inputs are kept
beside it, because a merge that silently dropped rows is worse than no merge.
